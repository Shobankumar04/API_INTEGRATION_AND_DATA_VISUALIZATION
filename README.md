DESCRIPTION:GeeksforGeeks assisted me in my initial foray into API integration and data visualization. I understood that an API can fetch real-time data, but I really wanted to grasp the overall concept of how it functioned. The API, REST, and the HTTP methods, along with JSON, were my initial learning curves and it was step-by-step from GeeksforGeeks that I could understand the basics. After I learned how to call APIs and retrieve data, the next step was to process this data. The raw data was generally very huge and often required some processing, especially when it comes from APIs. Therefore, I had to filter and sort it. I learned data manipulation using tools from GeeksforGeeks like pandas, making the extraction of relevant information simpler. After cleaning the data, it was finally time to present it visually. It was great fun to present data in a clear manner. GeeksforGeeks showed me the way to create charts and graphs by Matplotlib and Seaborn. Data visualizations indeed gave me more clarity into trends and patterns. It was an enriching experience in terms of API integration and data visualization. GeeksforGeeks was the tool that allowed me to divide the learning into more manageable chunks, allowing application of what I learned during this process.
